# LuNA 16 Dataset Analysis, Model Architecture and Training

This directory contains the Jupyter Notebooks used to analyze the LuNA 16 dataset, design the model architecture and train the model.

TODO: 
- Look into notes from designong ML systems and implement the model development cycle here.

## Notebooks

The following notebooks are included in this directory.

### Overview (`luna16.ipynb`)

This notebook provides an overview of the LuNA 16 dataset.

### Data Analysis (`data_exploration.ipynb`)

This notebook provides an analysis of the dataset.

TODO: 
- Plot diameters, distribution of series UIDs, etc.
- Does it matter that some CTs have much more candidates than others?
- Compare how many duplicates are between annotations nodules and nodules in candidates.


### Processed Data & Datasets (`processing_data.ipynb`)

This notebook describes the processed data and datasets used for training.

### Model Architecture and Training (`training.ipynb`)

This notebook describes the model architecture and training.
